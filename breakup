Hey [His Name],

I need to talk to you about something that's been weighing on my heart. I've been thinking a lot, and I believe it's best for us to break up. This decision hasn't come lightly, and I want you to know how much I've valued our time together.

I think we both deserve to be with someone who fully aligns with what we need and want in a relationship. I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and I want us to part on good terms.

Please let's discuss this further when you're ready. I appreciate your understanding.

Take care,
[Your Name]
